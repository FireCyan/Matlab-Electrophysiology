These are Matlab objects that I have written myself (except abfload.mat) for the analysis of 
neural spikes to artificial electrical stimulation, including intracellular current injection through recording pippette and
extracellular stimulation. This is for my postgraduate project in Bionic eye.

A lot of functions have been written for plotting, so it may be useful to use some of them for your own plotting.
